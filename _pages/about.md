About me
======
Hi, readers.

Welcome to my webpage. It's not only an academic page but also where I share my writting passion to the public. This webpage will include contents about my life at Miami, studing tips and machine learning, of course.

I will be joining the [Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University](https://www.cis.fiu.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a PhD Student working closely with [Dr. Cuong V. Nguyen](https://nvcuong.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I spent a wonderful year working as a machine learning engineer at [FPT Smart Cloud](https://fptcloud.com/){:target="_blank"} in the Vietnamese OCR project. Let's check our products at [FPT AI Reader Platform](https://fpt.ai/reader-en){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in **machine learning** and **computer vision**.
